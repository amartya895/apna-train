          PNR Status tells the latest seat berth status of passenger in Indian
          Railways i.e. whether passenger has got confirmed reservation,
          Reservation Against Cancellation (RAC) or the passenger is in waiting
          list. For waiting list or rac passengers, pnr status might change to
          confirmed in future if other passengers on this trip cancel their
          journey. For passengers who have cancelled their trip, it is shown as
          Can/Mod. Train PNR status also tells the origin station, boarding point,
          destination station, travel class, quota and charting status. Once final
          chart is prepared, the indian railway PNR status live freezes and does
          not change after that.
